## This fork of 'instant-everything' includes instant repair functionality, which no longer works due to packet integrity implementation and limitations of TERA Toolbox. Unless you're being next level ethical I guess ;)

# instant-everything
Removes the annoying animation and skips the progress bar for enchanting, upgrading, repairing, soulbinding, dismantling, and merging items.

Each mode can be toggled by using the in-game command `instant [mode]`, with `[mode]` being `enchant`, `upgrade`, `repair`, `soulbind`, `merge`, or `dismantle`.

### Installation Instructions

1. Download and extract into the `mods` folder of your TERA Toolbox.
2. Copy folder `data` folder into your toolbox folder. (NOTE: Every patch you have to come back here and redo this step for updated files)
